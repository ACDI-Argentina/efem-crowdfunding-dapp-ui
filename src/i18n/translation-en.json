    "faq1Answer": "Give4Forest is a decentralized cryptocurrency fundraising platform for early financing of digital solutions aimed at the protection and development of nature and the communities that inhabit it.<br/><br/>The platform is made up of three (3) entities that manage the flow of donations in the system. Each of these entities corresponds to one or more smart contracts.<br/><br/><ul><li>DACs: Communities built around a cause that users can donate to. Each DAC is owned by a Delegate who can delegate donations to solutions that fund actions that support the DAC's mission.</li><li>Solutions: individual projects associated with a Campaign Manager, which have Milestones through which the project can obtain funding.</li><li>Milestones: milestones within a Solution, which are the only way to remove the donated funds from the system, under certification of compliance. Proposed milestones must be approved by the Campaign Manager and must follow a multi-person workflow to ensure the milestone is achieved.</li></ul></br>DACs and Solutions may be linked to each other, but may also exist as independent entities.",
    
    "faq2Question": "Which cryptocurrencies does the platform accept?",
    "faq2Answer": "Give4Forest operates on the <linkRsk>RSK</linkRsk> network, the most secure smart contract platform, protected by the Bitcoin network. It accepts RSK's native RBTC cryptocurrency and ERC20 RIF and DOC tokens. The funder can support the full technology solution or a milestone.",
